# hackathon_genAI
Hackathon to create, train and use generative AI models in software engineering tasks.

## Goals
The main goal of this hackathon is to create awareness of the potential of generative AI models in software engineering tasks. The participants will be able to create, train and use generative AI models in software engineering tasks.

We use Hugging Face's transformers library to create, train and use generative AI models. The library is very well documented and has a large community of users and contributors. It is also relatively easy to use and to modify.

## Before the hackathon
Before attending the hackathon, you need to prepare your environment for it. What you need is:

1. Python environment -- Python 3.11 is recommended, because it is not the latest one, but relatively new so still supported. You can use any Python environment you like, but I recommend using pyenv to manage your Python versions.
